# Face Expression Recognition Project

This repository contains the code and models for identifying facial expressions using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project includes models deployed with Flask/Gunicorn and Streamlit or HuggingFace, along with a dataset for training and testing.

## Models Included

1. **Transfer Learning with Additional Layers**: Model trained on top of pre-trained EfficientNet/VGG with additional layers.
2. **Transfer Learning with Unfreezing Layers**: Model trained on top of pre-trained EfficientNet/VGG by unfreezing some existing layers.
3. **CNN Model**: Convolutional Neural Network model to identify facial expressions directly.
4. **GAN Model**: Generative Adversarial Network model for facial expression generation.
5. **VAE Model**: Variational Autoencoder model for facial expression generation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models can be found in the [FaceExpressions.zip](link-to-dataset) file.
